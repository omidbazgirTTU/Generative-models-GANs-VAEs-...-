        "## Challenges With Evaluating GANs\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Loss is Uninformative of Performance\n",
        "One aspect that makes evaluating GANs challenging is that the loss tells us little about their performance. Unlike with classifiers, where a low loss on a test set indicates superior performance, a low loss for the generator or discriminator suggests that learning has stopped. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### No Clear Non-human Metric\n",
        "If you define the goal of a GAN as \"generating images which look real to people\" then it's technically possible to measure this directly: [you can ask people to act as a discriminator](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01121). However, this takes significant time and money so ideally you can use a proxy for this. There is also no \"perfect\" discriminator that can differentiate reals from fakes - if there were, a lot of machine learning tasks would be solved ;)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will implement Fr√©chet Inception Distance, one method which aims to solve these issues. "

However, instead of using the classification labels of the Inception-v3 network, it uses the output from an earlier layer‚Äîthe layer right before the labels. This is often called the feature layer. Research has shown that deep convolutional neural networks trained on difficult tasks, like classifying many classes, build increasingly sophisticated representations of features going deeper into the network. For example, the first few layers may learn to detect different kinds of edges and curves, while the later layers may have neurons that fire in response to human faces.\n",

        "Fr√©chet distance uses the values from the feature layer for two sets of images, say reals and fakes, and compares different statistical properties between them to see how different they are. Specifically, Fr√©chet distance finds the shortest distance needed to walk along two lines, or two curves, simultaneously. The most intuitive explanation of Fr√©chet distance is as the \"minimum leash distance\" between two points. Imagine yourself and your dog, both moving along two curves. If you walked on one curve and your dog, attached to a leash, walked on the other at the same pace, what is the least amount of leash that you can give your dog so that you never need to give them more slack during your walk? Using this, the Fr√©chet distance measures the similarity between these two curves.\n",
